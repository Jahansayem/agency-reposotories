## Executive Summary

The 2026 Allstate Agency Compensation Program introduces significant changes to how agency bonuses are calculated and paid. The key shift is from a dual-metric system (PBR + PG) to a **Portfolio Growth-only** system with two components:

- **Auto/Home/AFS Component:** Up to 3% of eligible written premium
- **Other Personal Lines Component:** Up to 1% of eligible written premium
- **Total Maximum:** 4% of eligible written premium

A **Standard Auto Only Loss Ratio qualifier** must be met to unlock the bonus.
